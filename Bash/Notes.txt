# Comparison  in Bash

- In Bash, 
comparison can be performed using various operators for strings, integers, 
and file attributes. Below are the common types of comparisons and their syntax:

# String Comparison
- Equality:

if [ "$string1" = "$string2" ]; then
       echo "Strings are equal"
   fi

- Inequality:

if [ "$string1" != "$string2" ]; then
       echo "Strings are not equal"
   fi
-

- String Length:

if [ -z "$string" ]; then
       echo "String is empty"
   fi

   if [ -n "$string" ]; then
       echo "String is not empty"
   fi

- Lexicographical Comparison:
if [[ "$string1" < "$string2" ]]; then
       echo "$string1 is less than $string2"
   fi

   if [[ "$string1" > "$string2" ]]; then
       echo "$string1 is greater than $string2"
fi

- Integer Comparison
Equality:
if [ "$num1" -eq "$num2" ]; then
       echo "Numbers are equal"
   fi
- Inequality 
if [ "$num1" -ne "$num2" ]; then
       echo "Numbers are not equal"
   fi
- Greater Than:

if [ "$num1" -gt "$num2" ]; then
       echo "$num1 is greater than $num2"
fi

- Less Than:
if [ "$num1" -lt "$num2" ]; then
       echo "$num1 is less than $num2"
   fi


- Greater Than or Equal To:
if [ "$num1" -ge "$num2" ]; then
       echo "$num1 is greater than or equal to $num2"
   fi
   .

- Less Than or Equal To:

if [ "$num1" -le "$num2" ]; then
       echo "$num1 is less than or equal to $num2"
   fi

# File Comparison
- Check if a file exists:

if [ -e "$file" ]; then
       echo "File exists"
   fi


- Check if a file is a regular file:
if [ -f "$file" ]; then
       echo "It's a regular file"
fi

- Check if a directory exists:
if [ -d "$directory" ]; then
       echo "It's a directory"
fi


- Check if a file is readable:

if [ -r "$file" ]; then
       echo "File is readable"
fi


- Check if a file is writable:
if [ -w "$file" ]; then
       echo "File is writable"
fi


- Check if a file is executable:
if [ -x "$file" ]; then
       echo "File is executable"
fi


# Example Script

#!/bin/bash

string1="hello"
string2="world"
num1=5
num2=10
file=/home/luka/Desktop/devOpsPath/bash/Notes.txt
dir=/home/luka/Desktop/devOpsPath/bash
# String comparison  
if [ "$string1" != "$string2" ]; then
    echo "Strings are not equal"
fi

# Integer comparison
if [ "$num1" -lt "$num2" ]; then
    echo "$num1 is less than $num2"

    else:
    echo "Is greater then"
fi

# File comparison
if [ -e "$file" ];
then
    echo "$file exists"
else
    echo "$file does not exist"
fi
# directory comparison 
if [ -d  "$file" ]; then
    echo "$file exists"
else
    echo "$file does not exist"
fi
