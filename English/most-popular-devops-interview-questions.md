## General DevOps Questions

### 1. What is DevOps and why is it important?

**Answer:**
DevOps is a cultural and technical movement that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) to shorten the development lifecycle and provide continuous delivery with high software quality.

**Key benefits:**
- Faster time to market
- Improved collaboration between teams
- Increased deployment frequency
- Lower failure rate of new releases
- Shortened lead time between fixes
- Faster recovery time

### 2. What are the key principles of DevOps?

**Answer:**
- **Collaboration**: Breaking down silos between development and operations
- **Automation**: Automating repetitive tasks and processes
- **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**
- **Monitoring and Logging**
- **Feedback loops**: Quick feedback on deployments and issues
- **Cultural shift**: Shared responsibility for the entire application lifecycle

### 3. Explain the DevOps lifecycle stages

**Answer:**
1. **Plan**: Requirements gathering and project planning
2. **Code**: Writing and reviewing code
3. **Build**: Compiling and creating artifacts
4. **Test**: Automated and manual testing
5. **Release**: Preparing for deployment
6. **Deploy**: Deploying to production
7. **Operate**: Managing production environment
8. **Monitor**: Collecting metrics and feedback

### 4. What is the difference between Agile and DevOps?

**Answer:**
- **Agile**: Focuses on development methodology, iterative development, collaboration between business and development teams
- **DevOps**: Focuses on the entire software delivery pipeline, collaboration between development and operations teams, automation, and continuous delivery

They complement each other - Agile handles the development process while DevOps handles the deployment and operations process.

- **Execute (x)**: Permission to execute file (1)

**Format**: `rwxrwxrwx` (owner, group, others)

**Examples:**
```bash
chmod 755 file.sh    # rwxr-xr-x
chmod 644 file.txt   # rw-r--r--
chmod +x script.sh   # Add execute permission
```

### 8. How do you find and kill a process in Linux?

**Answer:**

## Docker and Containerization

### 9. What is Docker and why is it used?

**Answer:**
Docker is a containerization platform that packages applications and their dependencies into lightweight, portable containers.

**Benefits:**
- **Consistency**: Same environment across development, testing, and production
- **Portability**: Runs anywhere Docker is installed
- **Efficiency**: Lightweight compared to VMs
- **Scalability**: Easy to scale applications
- **Isolation**: Applications run in isolated environments

### 10. What is the difference between Docker Image and Container?

**Answer:**
- **Docker Image**: Read-only template used to create containers. It's like a blueprint or snapshot of an application with all its dependencies.
- **Docker Container**: Running instance of a Docker image. It's a lightweight, executable package that includes everything needed to run an application.

**Analogy**: Image is like a class in OOP, Container is like an object/instance of that class.

### 11. Explain Docker architecture

**Answer:**
Docker uses a client-server architecture:

- **Docker Client**: Command-line interface that communicates with Docker daemon
- **Docker Daemon**: Manages Docker objects (images, containers, networks, volumes)
- **Docker Registry**: Stores Docker images (Docker Hub, AWS ECR)
- **Docker Objects**: Images, containers, networks, volumes, plugins

### 12. What is a Dockerfile and write a sample one?

**Answer:**
A Dockerfile is a text file containing instructions to build a Docker image.

```dockerfile
# Use official Node.js runtime as base image
FROM node:14-alpine

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy package files
COPY package*.json ./

# Install dependencies
RUN npm install

# Copy application code
COPY . .

# Expose port
EXPOSE 3000

# Define startup command
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

### 13. What are Docker volumes and why are they used?

**Answer:**
Docker volumes are persistent storage mechanisms that exist outside container lifecycles.

**Types:**
- **Named volumes**: Managed by Docker
- **Bind mounts**: Map host filesystem to container
- **tmpfs mounts**: Stored in host memory

**Commands:**
```bash
# Create volume
docker volume create myvolume

# Mount volume
docker run -v myvolume:/app/data myimage

# Bind mount
docker run -v /host/path:/container/path myimage
```
