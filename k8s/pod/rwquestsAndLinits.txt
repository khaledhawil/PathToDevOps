# requests and limits in pod:
What Are Requests and Limits?
Requests: This is the minimum amount of resources (CPU and memory) that your container needs to run. 
Kubernetes uses this information to decide where to place your Pod. 
If a node doesn’t have enough resources to meet the request, your Pod won’t be scheduled there.

Limits: This is the maximum amount of resources that your container can use.


# - requests: 100m (100 miliseconds) = 0.1 CPU
# - limits: 200m (200 miliseconds) = 0.2 CPU
# - requests: 100Mi (100 Mebibytes) = 100 * 1024 * 1024 bytes
# - limits: 200Mi (200 Mebibytes) = 200 * 1024 * 1024 bytes
