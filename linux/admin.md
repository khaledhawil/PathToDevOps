# What is `stdin` in Linux?

In Linux, stdin (standard input) is a way for a program to receive input. Think of it as the programâ€™s "keyboard" where it listens for user input or data from another command.

### Simple Explanation:
- When you type something in the terminal and press Enter, it goes to stdin.
- Programs like cat, grep, and wc read from stdin unless you give them a file to read from.
- You can redirect the output of a command to stdin using the pipe (`|`) symbol.
## Ex
```bash
echo pass | sudo passwd --stdin ansible 
```
### Explanation (Step by Step):
1. `echo pass` will output the word "pass" to the terminal.
2. The `|` symbol is used to redirect the output of the command on the left side of the pipe
