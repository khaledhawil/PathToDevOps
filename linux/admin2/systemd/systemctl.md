### What is `systemd`? 
 
- **`systemd`** 
- is a system and service manager for Linux operating systems.
- It is designed to replace the traditional init system (like SysVinit) and provides a more efficient way to manage services, processes, and system states. 
- It uses units to represent various system resources, including services, sockets, devices, mount points, and more. 
 
### What is `systemctl`? 
 
- **`systemctl`** is the command-line tool used to interact with `systemd`. It allows administrators to control the state of the system and manage services. 
 
### Common `systemctl` Commands 
 
Here are some common `systemctl` commands that Linux administrators frequently use: 
 
#### 1. **Service Management** 
 
- **Start a service**:
```bash
sudo systemctl start <service_name>
```
- **Stop a service**:
```bash
sudo systemctl stop <service_name>
```
- **Restart a service**:
```bash
sudo systemctl restart <service_name>
```
- **Reload a service (without restarting)**:
```bash
sudo systemctl reload <service_name>
```
- **Enable a service to start on boot**:
```bash
sudo systemctl enable <service_name>
```
- **Disable a service from starting on boot**:
```bash
sudo systemctl disable <service_name>
```
- **Check the status of a service**:
```bash
sudo systemctl status <service_name>
```
#### 2. **System State Management** 
 
- **Reboot the system**:
```bash
sudo systemctl reboot
```
- **Power off the system**:
```bash
sudo systemctl poweroff
```
- **Suspend the system**:
```bash
sudo systemctl suspend
```
- **Hibernate the system**:
```bash
sudo systemctl hibernate
```
- **Check the system state**:
```bash
systemctl is-system-running
```
#### 3. **Service Management** 
 
- **List all active services**:
```bash
systemctl list-units --type=service
```
- **List all enabled services**:
```bash
systemctl list-unit-files --type=service
```
- **Show detailed information about a service**:
```bash
systemctl status <service_name> --no-pager
```
- **Mask a service (prevent it from being started)**:
```bash
sudo systemctl mask <service_name>
```
- **Unmask a service**:
```bash
sudo systemctl unmask <service_name>
``` 
#### 4. **Journal Management** 
 
- **View logs**:
```bash
journalctl
```
- **View logs for a specific service**:
```bash
journalctl -u <service_name>
```
- **Follow logs in real-time**:
```bash
journalctl -f -u <service_name>
```
- **View logs since the last boot**:
```bash
journalctl -b
```
