# Getting Started with DevOps Learning

## What You Need Before Starting

### Hardware Requirements

**Minimum:**
- 8GB RAM (16GB recommended)
- 50GB free disk space
- Dual-core processor (quad-core recommended)
- Stable internet connection

**Why these requirements?**
- Virtual machines and Docker containers consume memory
- Kubernetes clusters require multiple VMs
- Cloud CLI tools and IDEs need disk space
- Video tutorials and downloads require bandwidth

### Software Setup

This section explains what to install and why each tool is necessary.

## Essential Tools Installation

### 1. Operating System Choice

**Recommended: Ubuntu Linux 22.04 LTS or later**

**Why Linux?**
- 96.3% of web servers run Linux
- All major cloud providers use Linux
- DevOps tools are built for Linux first
- Most production environments are Linux-based
- Better for learning command line skills

**Alternatives:**
- **macOS:** Unix-based, similar to Linux, good for development
- **Windows:** Use WSL2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux) to run Linux

**If using Windows:**
- Install WSL2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux)
- Install Ubuntu from Microsoft Store
- This gives you a real Linux environment inside Windows

### 2. Terminal Emulator

**Linux/macOS:** Built-in terminal is sufficient
**Windows:** Windows Terminal (modern, tabbed interface)

**Why you need a good terminal:**
- You will spend 60-70% of your time in the terminal
- DevOps work is primarily command-line based
- Automation scripts run in terminals
- Remote server access is via terminal (SSH)

### 3. Text Editor / IDE

**For Beginners: Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**

**Why VS Code?**
- Free and open source
- Extensions for every language and tool
- Integrated terminal
- Git integration built-in
- Remote development capabilities
- Most popular editor among DevOps engineers

**Extensions to install:**
- Docker
- Kubernetes
- YAML
- Terraform
- Python
- Bash
- GitLens
- Remote - SSH

**Alternative editors:**
- Vim/Neovim (advanced, steep learning curve)
- Nano (simple, for quick edits)
- Sublime Text
- IntelliJ IDEA

### 4. Git

**Installation:**
```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt update
sudo apt install git -y

# macOS
brew install git

# Verify installation
git --version
```

**Why Git first?**
- You need to version control your learning materials
- Practice Git from day one
- All code examples should be in Git repositories
- Industry standard for version control

### 5. Virtual Machine Software

**VirtualBox (Free) or VMware**

**Why you need VMs:**
- Practice Linux without dual-booting
- Create test environments
- Simulate multi-server setups
- Learn Kubernetes requires multiple VMs
- Safe environment to make mistakes

**Alternative: Cloud-based labs**
- AWS Free Tier
- Google Cloud Platform Free Tier
- DigitalOcean (paid but cheap)
- Play with Docker (free, temporary)
- Play with Kubernetes (free, temporary)

## Setting Up Your Learning Environment

### Directory Structure

Create a organized workspace:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/devops-learning/{labs,projects,notes,scripts}
cd ~/devops-learning
```

**Explanation:**
- `labs/`: Hands-on practice exercises
- `projects/`: Larger projects that combine multiple skills
- `notes/`: Your personal notes and documentation
- `scripts/`: Automation scripts you write

### Git Configuration

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
git config --global init.defaultBranch main
```

**What each line does:**
- Line 1: Sets your name for Git commits
- Line 2: Sets your email for Git commits
- Line 3: Sets default branch name to 'main' (modern standard)

### GitHub Account

**Create a free account at github.com**

**Why GitHub?**
- Store your code in the cloud
- Build a portfolio of your work
- Collaborate with others
- Learn pull requests and code review
- Required for CI/CD learning
- Recruiters check GitHub profiles

## Learning Resources Setup

### Documentation Access

Bookmark these official documentation sites:
- Docker: docs.docker.com
- Kubernetes: kubernetes.io/docs
- Terraform: terraform.io/docs
- AWS: docs.aws.amazon.com
- Ansible: docs.ansible.com

**Why official docs?**
- Always up-to-date
- Most accurate information
- Comprehensive examples
- Search functionality
- Version-specific information

### Note-Taking System

**Recommended: Markdown files in Git**

Create a note template:

```bash
cat > ~/devops-learning/notes/template.md << 'EOF'
# Topic: [Topic Name]

## Date: [YYYY-MM-DD]

## What I Learned

[Summary of key concepts]

## Commands/Code

```bash
# Command with explanation
command --flag argument
```

## Questions/Challenges

- [Question 1]
- [Challenge faced]

## Resources

- [Link to documentation]
- [Tutorial followed]

## Next Steps

- [ ] Practice item 1
- [ ] Practice item 2
EOF
```

**Why this matters:**
- Writing reinforces learning
- You will forget details, notes help
- Build your personal documentation
- Review notes before interviews
- Share knowledge with others

## Practice Environment Setup

### Docker Installation

Docker is essential for modern DevOps. Install early to practice containerization concepts.

```bash
# Ubuntu installation
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
sudo sh get-docker.sh
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```

**What each command does:**
- Line 1: Downloads Docker installation script
- Line 2: Executes the installation script
- Line 3: Adds your user to docker group (run Docker without sudo)

**Logout and login again for group changes to take effect**

### Verify Installation

```bash
docker --version
docker run hello-world
```

**What happens:**
- Line 1: Shows Docker version
- Line 2: Downloads and runs a test container

## Daily Learning Routine

### Recommended Schedule

**Weekdays (3-4 hours):**
- 1 hour: Reading/watching tutorials
- 1.5 hours: Hands-on practice
- 0.5 hour: Documentation and note-taking
- 1 hour: Building small projects

**Weekends (4-6 hours):**
- 2 hours: Larger projects
- 2 hours: Reviewing the week's material
- 1-2 hours: Exploring advanced topics or side interests

### Learning Techniques

**Active Learning:**
- Type every command yourself
- Don't copy-paste without understanding
- Break things intentionally to learn troubleshooting
- Ask "why?" for every concept

**Project-Based Learning:**
- Build something after each topic
- Combine multiple skills in projects
- Document your projects on GitHub
- Write README files explaining your work

**Spaced Repetition:**
- Review previous week's material weekly
- Revisit fundamentals monthly
- Practice old skills while learning new ones

## Common Beginner Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Tutorial Hell
**Mistake:** Watching endless tutorials without practicing
**Solution:** Practice immediately after learning each concept

### 2. Skipping Fundamentals
**Mistake:** Jumping to Kubernetes before understanding Linux
**Solution:** Master each phase before moving forward

### 3. Not Reading Error Messages
**Mistake:** Giving up when seeing errors
**Solution:** Errors are teachers; read them carefully and search for solutions

### 4. Not Using Version Control
**Mistake:** Not committing work to Git regularly
**Solution:** Commit after each small achievement

### 5. Learning in Isolation
**Mistake:** Not engaging with communities
**Solution:** Join Discord servers, Reddit communities, and forums

**Discord:** DevOps community servers
**GitHub Discussions:** Tool-specific questions

### How to Ask Good Questions

1. Describe what you are trying to achieve
2. Show what you have tried
3. Include error messages (full text)
4. Mention your environment (OS, versions)
5. Be specific and provide context

### Example of a Bad Question:
"Docker doesn't work help"

### Example of a Good Question:
"I'm trying to run a Docker container on Ubuntu 22.04 with 'docker run nginx' but I get permission denied error. I installed Docker following the official guide. Error message: [full error]. What am I missing?"

## Motivation and Mindset

### It Will Be Challenging

DevOps is complex because it combines many disciplines:
- Systems administration
- Software development
- Networking
- Security
- Cloud computing

**This is normal. Everyone finds it challenging.**

### Imposter Syndrome

You will feel like you don't know enough. This feeling persists even for experienced engineers. The field is vast and constantly evolving.

**Remember:** You don't need to know everything, just enough to solve problems and keep learning.

### Celebrating Small Wins

Every small achievement matters:
- First successful Docker container
- First Git commit
- First script that automates a task
- First deployed application
- First troubleshooting success

Document these wins. They prove your progress.

## Next Steps

Once your environment is set up and you have committed to a learning schedule, proceed to:

**Phase 1: Fundamentals** (`01-fundamentals/`)

Start with Linux basics and build your foundation.

Remember: The journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step. You have taken that step by setting up your environment. Now it is time to start learning.
