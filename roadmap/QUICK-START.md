## How to Use This Roadmap

### Step 1: Start at the Beginning

Read the main `README.md` file first to understand the complete journey.

### Step 2: Set Up Your Environment

Go to `00-getting-started/README.md` and follow the setup instructions:
- Install required software
- Configure your development environment
- Create your learning workspace
- Establish a daily routine

### Step 3: Follow Sequential Order

Do not skip phases. Each builds on the previous:

**Week 1-4: Phase 1 - Fundamentals**
- Master Linux commands
- Understand networking basics
- Learn system administration

**Week 5-6: Phase 2 - Version Control**
- Learn Git fundamentals
- Practice GitHub workflows
- Understand branching strategies

**Week 7-10: Phase 3 - Programming**
- Write Bash scripts
- Learn Python basics
- Build automation scripts

**Week 11-16: Phase 4 - Infrastructure**
- Master Docker containerization
- Learn Kubernetes orchestration
- Practice Infrastructure as Code with Terraform

**Week 17-20: Phase 5 - CI/CD**
- Build Jenkins pipelines
- Create GitHub Actions workflows
- Implement automated testing

**Week 21-24: Phase 6 - Cloud and Monitoring**
- Deploy to AWS
- Set up Prometheus and Grafana
- Implement logging and alerting

**Week 25+: Phase 7 - Integration**
- Understand complete workflows
- Build end-to-end projects
- Practice real-world scenarios

### Step 4: Practice Extensively

Reading is not enough. For every concept:
- Type commands yourself
- Run examples
- Break things intentionally
- Fix what you broke
- Experiment with variations

### Step 5: Build Projects

After each phase, build something:
- **Phase 1:** Bash script to automate system tasks
- **Phase 2:** Multi-branch project with collaboration
- **Phase 3:** Automation script solving real problem
- **Phase 4:** Containerized multi-service application
- **Phase 5:** Complete CI/CD pipeline
- **Phase 6:** Monitored production deployment
- **Phase 7:** End-to-end DevOps project

## Key Concepts Explained

### Why This Order?

**Foundation First:**
You cannot use Docker without understanding Linux. You cannot debug Kubernetes without knowing processes and networking. Start with basics.

**Build Complexity Gradually:**
Each phase adds new tools that integrate with previous knowledge. By Phase 7, you understand how everything connects.

**Practical Application:**
Every concept includes real-world examples showing why it matters in DevOps.

### How Tools Connect

**Example Workflow:**
```
Developer writes code (Linux, Git, Python)
    ↓
Commits to Git repository (Git)
    ↓
CI/CD pipeline triggers (Jenkins/GitHub Actions)
    ↓
Builds Docker image (Docker)
    ↓
Deploys to Kubernetes (Kubernetes)
    ↓
Infrastructure provisioned (Terraform)
    ↓
Monitoring tracks metrics (Prometheus, Grafana)
    ↓
Alerts notify team of issues (Alertmanager)
```

Every tool has a purpose. Every tool connects to others. This roadmap shows both.

## What Makes This Different

### Complete Explanations

Not just "what" but "why" and "how":
- What is this command?
- Why does it matter in DevOps?
- How does it connect to other tools?
- When should you use it?

### Real-World Context

Every example comes from actual DevOps work:
- Deploying applications
- Troubleshooting issues
- Automating tasks
- Monitoring systems

### Integration Focus

Phase 7 ties everything together, showing complete end-to-end workflows that use all skills from previous phases.

## Common Questions

### How long will this take?

**Minimum:** 24 weeks with 4-6 hours daily practice
**Realistic:** 8-12 months for job-ready proficiency
**Mastery:** 2-3 years of continuous practice

### Can I skip phases?

No. Each phase builds on previous knowledge. Skipping creates knowledge gaps that will cause problems later.

### Do I need to memorize everything?

No. Understand concepts and know where to find information. You will reference documentation constantly even as experienced engineer.

### What if I get stuck?

- Read error messages carefully
- Search online for solutions
- Check official documentation
- Ask in DevOps communities
- Try different approaches
- Take breaks and come back

### Do I need all tools?

Yes, to be complete DevOps engineer. But you can start with subset:
- **Minimum:** Linux, Git, Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD
- **Recommended:** Add Python, Terraform, monitoring
- **Complete:** Everything in this roadmap

## Success Indicators

You are progressing well when:
- Concepts start connecting
- You can explain things to others
- You solve problems independently
- You build working projects
- You read documentation comfortably
- You think in terms of automation
- You understand trade-offs

## After Completing Roadmap

### Job Readiness

You will be prepared for:
- Junior DevOps Engineer
- Site Reliability Engineer (Entry)
- Platform Engineer
- Cloud Engineer

### Continuing Education

DevOps never stops evolving:
