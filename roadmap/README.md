# DevOps Roadmap: From Zero to Hero

## Overview

This roadmap provides a comprehensive, structured path to mastering DevOps from absolute beginner to expert level. Each phase builds upon the previous one, creating a solid foundation of knowledge and practical skills.

## Why This Roadmap?

DevOps is not a single tool or technology, but rather a culture and set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops). The goal is to shorten the development lifecycle while delivering features, fixes, and updates frequently in close alignment with business objectives.

## Learning Path Structure

The roadmap is divided into 6 phases, each representing a critical area of DevOps expertise:

### Phase 1: Fundamentals (Weeks 1-4)
**Foundation:** Operating Systems, Networking, Command Line

You must master the basics before moving to advanced topics. Linux is the backbone of most DevOps tools and cloud infrastructure.

**Time Investment:** 4-6 hours daily
**Outcome:** Comfortable navigating Linux systems, understanding networking concepts, and executing commands efficiently

### Phase 2: Version Control Systems (Weeks 5-6)
**Foundation:** Git, GitHub, Collaboration Workflows

Version control is essential for tracking changes, collaborating with teams, and maintaining code history. Every DevOps engineer uses Git daily.

**Time Investment:** 3-4 hours daily
**Outcome:** Proficiency in Git workflows, branching strategies, and collaborative development

### Phase 3: Programming and Scripting (Weeks 7-10)
**Foundation:** Bash, Python, Programming Concepts

Automation is the heart of DevOps. You need programming skills to write scripts, automate tasks, and understand application code.

**Time Investment:** 4-5 hours daily
**Outcome:** Ability to write automation scripts, understand application code, and solve problems programmatically

### Phase 4: Infrastructure and Containers (Weeks 11-16)
**Foundation:** Docker, Kubernetes, Infrastructure as Code, Terraform

Modern applications run in containers. Understanding containerization and orchestration is crucial for deploying and managing applications at scale.

**Time Investment:** 5-6 hours daily
**Outcome:** Deploy containerized applications, manage Kubernetes clusters, and define infrastructure as code

### Phase 5: CI/CD and Automation (Weeks 17-20)
**Foundation:** Jenkins, GitHub Actions, Pipeline Design

Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment automate the software delivery process, enabling faster and more reliable releases.

**Time Investment:** 4-5 hours daily
**Outcome:** Design and implement CI/CD pipelines, automate testing and deployment processes

### Phase 6: Cloud and Monitoring (Weeks 21-24)
**Foundation:** AWS, Prometheus, Grafana, Logging

Cloud platforms provide the infrastructure for modern applications. Monitoring and observability ensure systems run reliably and issues are detected quickly.

**Time Investment:** 5-6 hours daily
**Outcome:** Deploy applications to cloud platforms, implement monitoring solutions, and ensure system reliability

## How Tools Connect Together

### The DevOps Workflow

1. **Developer writes code** (Programming Skills - Phase 3)
   - Uses an IDE or text editor
   - Writes application code in Python, Java, Go, etc.
   - Writes infrastructure code in Terraform (Phase 4)

2. **Code is versioned** (Git - Phase 2)
   - Developer commits changes to Git
   - Pushes to GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket
   - Creates branches for features or fixes

3. **CI/CD pipeline triggers** (Jenkins/GitHub Actions - Phase 5)
   - Git webhook notifies CI/CD system of new code
   - Pipeline automatically starts
   - Runs on Linux-based build agents (Phase 1)

4. **Automated testing and building** (Phase 5)
   - Bash/Python scripts run tests (Phase 3)
   - Docker builds container images (Phase 4)
   - Artifacts are stored in registries

5. **Infrastructure provisioning** (Terraform - Phase 4)
   - Terraform creates cloud resources (AWS - Phase 6)
   - Kubernetes clusters are prepared (Phase 4)
   - Networks and security groups configured (Phase 1 & 6)

6. **Deployment** (Phase 4 & 5)
   - Docker containers are deployed
   - Kubernetes orchestrates container placement
   - Load balancers distribute traffic

7. **Monitoring and feedback** (Prometheus/Grafana - Phase 6)
   - Prometheus collects metrics
   - Grafana visualizes system health
   - Alerts notify team of issues
   - Logs are centralized and analyzed

8. **Continuous improvement** (All Phases)
   - Monitor metrics and user feedback
   - Identify bottlenecks and issues
   - Update code and infrastructure
   - Cycle repeats with new commits

## How to Use This Roadmap

1. **Follow the order:** Each phase builds on previous knowledge
2. **Practice extensively:** Theory without practice is useless
3. **Build projects:** Apply knowledge to real-world scenarios
4. **Document learning:** Keep notes on what you learn
5. **Join communities:** Engage with DevOps communities for support
6. **Stay updated:** Technology evolves rapidly; keep learning

## Time Commitment

**Minimum:** 24 weeks (6 months) with dedicated daily practice
**Realistic:** 8-12 months for job-ready proficiency
**Mastery:** 2-3 years of continuous learning and practice

## Prerequisites

- Basic computer literacy
- Ability to install software
- Willingness to learn and practice consistently
- Access to a computer (Linux preferred, but Windows/Mac works)

## Getting Started

Start with Phase 1 and work through each directory in order. Each phase contains:
- Detailed guides and explanations
- Hands-on labs and exercises
- Real-world examples
- Best practices and common pitfalls
- Integration points with other tools

## Success Metrics

You are ready to move to the next phase when you can:
- Complete all labs without assistance
- Explain concepts to someone else
- Debug common issues independently
- Apply knowledge to new scenarios
